            <p><b>June 19, 2020</b></p>
            
            <p>As of late I came to see an article which expressed a man who had engaged in sexual relations with 100 youngsters wishes to wed a woman who is virgin! How delightful right?
            </p>

            <p>What is virginity all about? I thought of sharing this in light of the fact that even in this 21st century, an enormous bit of the people consider this as a taboo which isn’t to be told or inspected in the general population. There are similarly various misinterpretations and myths regarding the same! So I might want to advance an inquiry to each and everybody that would you say you are virgin or not? Try not to stress! You will discover the response for this inquiry toward the finish of this.</p>

            <p>The old Greek methodology considered a man or a lady as virgin just on the off chance that the person in question hasn’t contacted the other sex. However, as the time passed, this idea changed to a degree. So as indicated by this idea in the event that we are inspecting an individual as virgin, would you say you are virgin or not? It is an extreme question to reply.</p>

            <p>Heading to the current situation, the young men are giving more significance to virginity. They used to give more significance to the virginity of young ladies. So how would they judge whether the young lady is virgin or not?</p>

            <p>It is said that during the hour of first sex, the presence of blood is an indicator that the young lady is virgin . However, is it the correct method to check whether she is virgin or not? It’s not! Blood may come at certain occurrences on the grounds that inside the vagina there is a layer called Hymen- a film which halfway shuts the opening of the vagina, which may rupture during the primary sex. However it shifts in every person. It can be broken by an abrupt fall or shock, inclusion of a vaginal tampon, dynamic cooperation in certain games like horseback riding, cycling, and so on. In addition, in certain ladies, the hymen continues considerably even after the intercourse. Hence, the presence or absence of hymen is not a reliable indicator of virginity or sexual experience. So what actually is virginity?</p>

            <p>Virginity is all about trust and love. It’s just a trust one have with their partner that gives them consolation throughout everyday life and encourages them to mend off their sorrows. Even in this current situation, youngsters are not given appropriate training or education about sex and sexual life, which at last is prompting everyone of these confusions. So my companions the subject of virginity is of no significance, every one of these misinterpretations are just because of the absence of legitimate instruction and absence of cooperation with young ladies. As referenced before, it’s everything about trust and love. So as the building block of our country, we should attempt to build up a psychological bond with others to take out these current fantasies and misguided judgments.</p>
