 <p>The first IEEE SIGHT group was initiated in the College of Engineering Chengannur in 2013 and has consistently pursued its goal of being devoted to humanitarian services and providing to the less privileged. It has had numerous volunteers pooling their ideas to partner with and provide help to those belonging to backward communities. It has partnered with other organizations to promote certain communities and introduce them to new technologies and opportunities. It has encouraged students to combine their engineering skills with their inherent humanitarian side and has helped in the holistic development of all it's student volunteers. One of its remarkable achievements were the relief operations conducted during the unprecedented Kerala floods during 2018. By exposing them to different sections of society, they are able to comprehend the shortcomings experienced by certain people and provide them with the necessary requirements.</p>

               <p>During its duration in IEEE SB CEC, SIGHT has proved to be an exemplary model of how engineering students could use their technological skill combined with inherent human nature to contribute for the well being of the society they share with others, and it will continue setting a model for other colleges throughout the region to look up to.
