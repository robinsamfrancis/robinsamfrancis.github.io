            <p><b>Abstract</b></p>
            <p>This project describes an approach of creating a system for identifying fruits, vegetables and other products in the retail market using images captured with a video camera attached to the system. The system helps to label the desired projects with a price according to its weight. The purpose of the system is to minimize the number of human computer interactions, speed up the identification process and improve the usability compared to existing manual systems. As a second objective, we have trained a deep neural network that is capable of identifying fruits and vegetables from images. This is part of a more complex project that has the target of obtaining a classifier that can identify a much wider array of objects from images. The pillar of automatic identification is Barcode technology, which is used comprehensively in real time applications with various types of codes. Moreover, it will be angle invariant, requires less user interaction than usual and can be executed on available computers. This model helps consumers to minimize the time for the billing system in shopping. User interface allows to organise the work better  and employs tools for generating the analytics. Corresponding to the weight of the product, a price is computed, and a bill is generated.
            </p>
            <p><b>Objective</b></p>
            <p>Our main objective is to create a smart, reliable and automated billing system affordable to the small and middle scaled shop owners to stay on track with modern business tools. Barcode Scanner and Computer based billing systems are not affordable owing to their high cost and taking large space requirements.</p>

            <p>Here we build a product that can feature a billing system with advanced technological capability such as AI and Computer Vision and which can integrate â€“ Barcode Scanner, Computer and Weighing System.
</p>

<p>Complex and time-consuming systems may result in customers choosing another grocery store. Since customers are the reason companies survive, their satisfaction is the businesses key to success. The necessity of systems which decrease the process time exists because of consumers' expectations of their constant endeavour to save time. Accordingly, the purpose of this work is to improve the identification process of fruit and vegetables in the retail market using CNN techniques and to identify other products using barcodes using computer vision.</p>

<p>More specifically, the improvement should consist of a faster process and a more user-friendly system. The purpose of implementing computer vision to the system is to narrow the selection of possible objects and thus reduce the strain on the billing process. Additionally, the use of computer vision in self-service systems can simplify the process of identifying objects by moving the process from a human to a computer. Theoretically, this could hasten the process to identify products and minimize the amount of errors by removing the human factor. The work of this paper will be mainly focused on identification and billing the corresponding objects. In terms of hardware, the fundamentals are a camera, a display, a weighing mechanism, and a processor to run the system. An image classifier has been trained and evaluated to classify images of fruits and vegetables from the camera. For classification purposes, we will investigate convolutional neural networks (CNN) architectures, given the huge success shown in recent years by CNNs in several object recognition and classification tasks. A user interface has been developed as well to handle user interaction via the display. The display will show a graphical user interface (GUI) for the user to interact with and present the classifiers output.
