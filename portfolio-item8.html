            <p><b>February, 2020</b></p>
            <p>You all got curious about the question, right? Every teenager here comes up with these questions, even me! It was my vacation and I was jobless and didnâ€™t know how to utilize the time. This is when I got stuck with these thoughts. Here are the points that I concluded while I was thinking the same.
            </p>

            <p>1. <b></b>Read a lot:</b> Reading is very important as it helps us to grow mentally, emotionally and psychologically. One of the main things that our teenagers lack is the habit of reading. We are all busy with our own stuff and can't find at least a second for reading books. But we have to accept the fact that it gives us more opportunities to learn and explore more ideas.</p>

            <p>2. <b></b>Surround yourself with leaders:</b>Leadership is a special quality that is not easily achievable. It's a quality that an individual acquires through his/her persistent hard work, dedication, and willpower to face challenges in his life. Hence, it is time for us to surround ourselves with these people and inculcate their qualities to build a good future. </p>

            <p>3. <b>Be different:</b>Every individual in this world is different. We are different based on our skills, ideas, beliefs, etc. So it's important for us to realize that we are different. We don't have to imitate what others are doing or shouldn't feel that we are not able to do what he or she is doing. Try to find the real potential in you and follow your inner moonlight.</p>

            <p>4.<b>Be a good observer:</b>We are now living in a world of illusions. It's difficult for us to differentiate what is right and wrong. We can't blindly believe a person in this present scenario. Nowadays people lose their love for each other and get involved in every dirty practice for acquiring money. In search of money, people forget their dignity as well as integrity. So it's time for us to observe people and learn from them.</p>

            <p>5.<b>Develop communication skills:</b>Lack of communication skills is one of the major problems the youngsters are facing now. We may have good ideas, but if we can't express it in a right and meaning full way then that is the use of having good ideas. We have to be more fluent in our language so that they won't have any situation as such.</p>
