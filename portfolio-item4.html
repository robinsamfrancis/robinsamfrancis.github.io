            <p><b>IEEE Student Branch College of Engineering Chengannur</b></p>
            <p>College of Engineering, Chengannur (CEC) has always been a very active node of IEEE. The Student
Branch has seen a continuous rise in participation and activities over the years. It has gained
widespread fame for the founding of IEEE LINK (Local Integrated Network of Kerala), which
continues contributing to IEEE Student Branches in Kerala to this day. Moreover, the Student
Branch has maintained its rate of growth throughout all these years since its establishment in 1996,
three years after the establishment of the college. Since then, the student branch has been ardent
in pursuing its mission to deliver graduate and undergraduate students under any engineering
stream with opportunities for their technical and professional development. Through the years, the
branch has come a long way and has consolidated its position in the Kerala Section and Region 10 as
one of the largest and most vibrant student branches. The Student Branch has always been a major
power in driving numerous activities of the section and many of its members are still acclaimed as
pioneers of the same. It has set up a benchmark for all the student branches in the section by
sharing its experience about its journey from a humble beginning to be one of the most influential
student branches in the Kerala Section.

            <p><b>Seethalayam</b></p>
            <p>Seethalayam (Women Health care project, Department of Homoeopathy, Govt of Kerala) aims at
empowering and uplifting Women socially by assuring care encompassing all planes of health, also
encourage women to be placed in careers that suit them for manyfold reasons; most importantly
recognising its immense role in boosting their self esteem.</p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>IEEE Special Interest Group on Humanitarian Technology College of Engineering Chengannur in
collaboration with Seethalayalam has arised with an initiative to inspire women to pursue their dreams,
nonetheless their age. As a part of programs, several webinars, seminars, outreach programs etc are
planned that aims at women empowerment and upliftment.</p>

<p><b>Vision</b></p>
<p>● To make women self-aware of their immense potential.</p>
<p>● To contribute our part in increasing the presence of skilled women in various industries</p>
<p>● To enable aspiring women in getting another chance to learn more about their fields of
interest</p>
<p>● To help increase the collective skill of the working class demographic by equipping one half
with relevant and basic technical prowess.</p>

<p><b>Action Plan</b></p>
<p>As our goal is to promote women and cultivate in them the confidence to create an identity for
themselves, we need a proper schedule on how and when things must be done. The sequence of events
will be a series of webinars hosted by SIGHT in collaboration with Seethalayam to make the women
realise their capabilities which will be followed by outreach programs and hands on sessions to increase
their skill level. </p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>The real meaning of women empowerment is to encourage women to be self-reliant, to make them
familiar with the available career options and motivate them to rebuild their career. It's also important
to familiarise them with the latest technologies and medical assistance thereby to improve their health
and well being. Our mission is to provide an opportunity to the women out there to realise their
potential and work towards their career dreams, especially for the ones who are struggling to get back
to work after taking a long career break. These webinars will help them to improve their technical
knowledge and at the end of these sessions, they will be able to recognise their area of interest by exploring different career options. As Diane Von Furstenberg said, “To be a woman is a great privilege,
and it’s important we remember it.“ Our aim is to remind these ladies of the wide range of opportunities
lying before them either to begin their career or to kick start it from a pause. After all, it's never too late
for a woman to pursue her dreams.</p>
